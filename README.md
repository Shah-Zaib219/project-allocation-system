Projex â€“ Workerâ€“Employer Platform (Flutter & Firebase)

I named this project Projex because it represents a Project Exchange platform where Employers can post tasks, and Workers can bid, collaborate, and deliver results seamlessly. It is inspired by platforms like Upwork but customized for easier management with a strong focus on skills, deadlines, and transparency.

âœ¨ Key Features

Employer Panel: Post projects with budget, skills, and deadlines. Review bids and hire based on worker profiles.

Worker Panel: View skill-matched projects (before deadline), place bids, track bid status & project progress. Update work status (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%).

Employer Actions: Accept one bid, track project updates, mark projects as completed, give ratings & reviews.

Worker Dashboard: View completed projects, accepted bids, average rating, total earnings, client reviews, and project history.

Admin Panel (Web): Manage users, activate/deactivate accounts, add skills, monitor projects & system activities.

Local Storage (Sqflite): Cache sessions to avoid repeated logins and ensure smooth offline support.

Notifications: Real-time updates from Admin and system alerts.

User Support: In-app Help Section with guidelines, FAQs, and support.

Report System: Workers and Employers can report issues or misconduct, flagged directly to the Admin.

Easy Logout: One-tap logout for quick and secure session handling.

ðŸ¤– AI-based Skill Matching

ðŸ›  Role-Based Dashboards (different UIs for employers, workers, and admins)

These upgrades will make it comparable to global freelancing platforms like Upwork and Fiverr.
